# Version 1.0
Demo Version (Initial Release with Tkinter GUI)


# Version 1.1
ImGui Migration: Replaced Tkinter with ImGui to resolve thread conflicts and stabilize the rendering loop.

Core Refactoring: Rewrote `src/main_final.py` and `src/gui.py` files to fully adapt to the ImGui architecture.

Controls Update: Remapped camera rotation from Left Click to Right Click to prevent interference with UI interactions.
